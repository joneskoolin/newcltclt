			<p>There is no lack of spectator sports in Charlotte.  Long known as the home of the Charlotte Motor Speedway (CMS), the Mecca of NASCAR, 2010 saw the opening of the NASCAR Hall of Fame in downtown Charlotte, offering yet another reason for rabid NASCAR fans to visit.  CMS is the largest facility in the Southeast and recognized as one of the finest in the country.  With the Speedway's capacity of nearly 180,000, the attendance for its largest race, The Coca-Cola 600, has the second-largest attendance of all sporting events in the nation.  CMS is also the site for race team testing and automobile manufacturing research.

            <p></p>NFL owners unanimously selected North Carolina as the 29th NFL franchise in 1993.  Just ten years later, the Carolina Panthers won a trip to play in Super Bowl XXXVIII against the New England Patriots.  The 2010 average attendance for the Panthers was 72,597, one of the highest in the NFL for that season, and a tribute to their continuing success.  The Panther's home is the $187 million state-of-the-art Bank of America Stadium in downtown Charlotte.</p>

<p>When the Charlotte Hornets relocated from Charlotte to New Orleans, the NBA promised Charlotte a new team and they got one in 2004 - The Carolina Bobcats.  In 2010, basketball legend Michael Jordan announced he was buying the majority ownership of the team.  The $260 million Time Warner Cable Arena was built in city center specifically for the NBA team but the arena is also used by the Charlotte Checkers of the National Hockey League as well as for other major events.</p>

<p>In addition to these major professional sports teams, there is also professional baseball, lacrosse, golf, and soccer as well as collegiate football and basketball events in the area..</p>
